This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), each sized 28x28 pixels. In this project, I built a neural network model to classify these digits accurately. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is particularly effective for image data due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies through convolutional layers. The dataset was first preprocessed by normalizing pixel values and reshaping images to fit the input requirements of the network. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, and fully connected layers with ReLU activations and a final softmax layer for classification. After training the model on the training set and validating its performance on the test set, it achieved high accuracy in predicting handwritten digits. This project illustrates the application of deep learning in computer vision and serves as a foundational example for more complex image classification tasks.
